# Python Beginner Projects

This repository contains simple Python scripts I created while learning the basics of programming.  
The goal is to practice Python fundamentals such as file handling, data parsing, and small automation tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- **cal.py** â†’ A simple calculator that performs +, -, *, /
- **csv_reader.py** â†’ Reads data from `data.csv` and prints each row
- **data.csv** â†’ Sample CSV file with example data
- **text_cleaner.py** â†’ Cleans a text file by removing blank lines and extra spaces
- **messy_text.txt** â†’ Sample messy text file for cleaning

## ðŸ›  Skills Practiced
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- File handling (reading/writing CSV and TXT)
- Data parsing & cleaning
- Problem solving with small scripts

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
I will continue adding new beginner-friendly Python projects as I learn more.
